## Covid-detection-using-CNN-in-deep-Learning


### In the above code with the help of the convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm on the X ray images of the Covid and Non-covid the model has build to detect the covid based on the trained data.
### With the help of  Keras, TensorFlow, and numpy  Libraries model has been built in Python.


### Dataset Link - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pranavraikokte/covid19-image-dataset


## How to run?


### Open the file in Google Colab, Mount the drive, Download the dataset upload it on the drive and at the time of test and train where the dataset or image is required give the path from the drive.
